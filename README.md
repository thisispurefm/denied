# denied
denied | notifies user they have been denied from accessing a website within PureNet


Denied is a simple HTML site which we host internally to PureFM's network which gets shown to users when they attempt to access websites the Technical Director deems they shouldn't from a computer on PureNet. (YouTube, Spotify, etc, etc).

It was made quick and dirty, so it's a body. However - it works and should only be seen rarely. So... eh, it'll do.

## Usage
clone this repo into the webroot for your webserver. That's it. The webserver will handle the rest.
